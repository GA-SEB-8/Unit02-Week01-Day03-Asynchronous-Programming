## Version 1.0 - Updates from legacy content

- `then()` and `catch()` examples are contained in a single microlesson, and are not used throughout the module.
- `setTimeout()` examples are contained to a single microlesson, and is not used throughout the module.
- Expand on written lecture material to provide a more straightforward outline for instructors to deliver content with and to provide more thorough written documentation for students.
