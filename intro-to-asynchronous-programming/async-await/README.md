**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will understand how the `async`/`await` syntax applies to asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

## Asynchronous code and the challenge with callbacks

Developers will often nest several functions in order to perform multiple asynchronous operations that depend on one another. However, when callbacks need to call functions that also accept callbacks, it leads to deeply nested structures. This is known as "callback hell" or the "pyramid of doom". The resulting code becomes harder to read and more difficult to debug.

To see an example, let's create two more files similar to the `test.txt` file we created before:

```bash
touch test2.txt test3.txt
```

Put the following content in `test2.txt`:

```plaintext
hello 2!
```

Repeat the process again with a `test3.txt` file:

```plaintext
hello 3!
```

Now let's update `app.js` to print the contents of all of these files asynchronously:

```javascript
const fs = require('node:fs');

fs.readFile('test.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  console.log(data);
  fs.readFile('test2.txt', 'utf8', (err2, data2) => {
    console.log(data2);
    fs.readFile('test3.txt', 'utf8', (err3, data3) => {
      console.log(data3);
    });
  });
});

console.log('run this as soon as possible');
```

Test the code!

```bash
node app.js
```

Now, imagine many more layers of this structure in a larger application. While it works as intended, this code leads to deeply nested functions that become difficult to read and maintain.

## Introducing `async`/`await`

The *`async`/`await`* syntax is an alternate way of handling operations that don't happen instantaneously.

> ðŸ“š When the *`async`* keyword is used when defining a function, it allows us to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before executing more code in that function.
>
> This is accomplished by using the *`await`* operator. It  pauses the execution of the rest of the code in a function until an asynchronous operation has finished. The `await` operator can only be used inside of an `async` function.
>
> Often, we don't want to continue executing the code in a function until we have the results of what we're waiting on. For example, if we're requesting data from a database, we would want to ensure we've retrieved that data before trying to do something with it later in the function.

### Anatomy of an `async` Function

![Anatomy of an `async` Function](./assets/anatomy-of-async.png)

1. Note `functionName` could be anything, just like any other function.
2. Use the `async` keyword immediately before the function definition.
3. Inside the asynchronous function, use `await` to pause further execution until the asynchronous operation is complete. `someAsyncAction()` could be any asynchronous action.

## Implementing `async`/`await` syntax

Let's replace the callback-based file reading structure with `async/await` for cleaner code:

```javascript
const fs = require('node:fs/promises');

const readDataFiles = async () => {
  const data = await fs.readFile('test.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log(data);
  const data2 = await fs.readFile('test2.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log(data2);
  const data3 = await fs.readFile('test3.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log(data3);
}

readDataFiles();

console.log('run this as soon as possible');
```

Test the code:

```bash
node app.js
```

### What's changed

- We've changed the `require` statement to `const fs = require('node:fs/promises');`. This imports the promise-based variant of Node's `fs` module. It's designed to work with `async`/`await` syntax.

- We created an `async` function named `readDataFiles`.

- Inside `readDataFiles()`, we use `await` before each `fs.readFile` call. This pauses the function's execution until each file read is complete, allowing the code to run line-by-line, similar to synchronous code.

- With `await`, `fs.readFile` directly returns the file's contents as a string. This allows us to assign the file's content to variables (`data`, `data2`, `data3`) without callback functions.

- It's important to note that you still see the text "run this as soon as possible" first. This behavior hasn't changed.

## Benefits of `async`/`await`

- **Readable code**: Using `async` and `await` makes the code flow more like synchronous code, improving readability.

- **Avoids callback hell**: By using `await`, we avoid nesting and make our code look more like a series of synchronous operations.
